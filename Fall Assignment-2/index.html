<section id="history">
    <h2>History of Jolly Rancher</h2>
    <p>Jolly Rancher was created in 1949 by Bill and Dorothy Harmsen in Golden, Colorado. Originally, the company sold chocolates and ice cream. However, to stay relevant during the winter months, the Harmsens introduced their now-famous hard candies. Their goal was to provide a “friendly, Western company,” hence the name "Jolly Rancher." Over the decades, Jolly Rancher has grown to be an iconic brand known worldwide for its vibrant flavors and long-lasting sweetness. It has become a staple in candy bowls and trick-or-treat bags everywhere.</p>
